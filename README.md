# Data Analyst Internship Case Study

Welcome to my Data Analyst Internship Case Study! In this project, I utilized Excel to clean and analyze a dataset related to music. Below is an overview of the analysis conducted:

## Overview
This case study aims to explore various aspects of the music dataset, including key distribution, song duration, predictive factors for streams, engagement rates of YouTube videos, title analysis, and momentum calculation.

## Analysis Highlights
1. **Visualizing Key Distribution**: Created a visualization to easily identify the most commonly used key and the distribution of keys across all the music in the dataset.

2. **Duration Conversion**: Converted the duration of each song into minutes and seconds and provided a table showing the number of songs grouped by duration in minutes.

3. **Predictive Factors for Streams**: Analyzed factors such as Loudness, Speechiness, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Valence, and Tempo to determine which one is most predictive of the number of streams.

4. **Engagement Rate Calculation**: Calculated the engagement rate for each YouTube video and compared the performance of official videos versus unofficial ones.

5. **Title Analysis**: Determined the number of words in each YouTube title and investigated if the number of words affects the number of views of the video.

6. **Momentum Calculation**: Introduced a new column called Momentum, calculated as the number of YouTube views divided by the number of days since release. This metric helps understand the momentum of a song, and the song with the highest momentum was identified.
